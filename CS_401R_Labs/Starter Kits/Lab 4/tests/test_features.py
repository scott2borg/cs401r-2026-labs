"""
NorthStar Retail — Feature Engineering Unit Tests
CS 401R Lab 4 Starter Kit

These tests validate your Lab 2 feature engineering pipeline — the code that
transforms raw transaction and customer data into the 11 model features
used by the churn prediction model.

Run locally:
    pytest tests/test_features.py -v

Design principle: Unit test the feature logic in isolation using small,
controlled DataFrames — do not depend on the full synthetic dataset.

# ── Import your feature engineering module ─────────────────────────────────────
# Lab 2 implements feature engineering in PySpark (data/glue-scripts/feature_engineer.py),

# testable functions in data/feature_engineering.py that operate on pandas DataFrames,
# then have the Glue job and these tests share that logic.
#
# That refactor IS the assignment here: code you cannot test in isolation is code you
# cannot gate a pipeline on.
