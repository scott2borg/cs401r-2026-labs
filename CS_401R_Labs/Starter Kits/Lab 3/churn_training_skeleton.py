NorthStar Retail — Churn Prediction Training Script (Skeleton)
CS 401R Lab 3 Starter Kit

This script is the SageMaker XGBoost training entry point for the NorthStar
churn prediction model. It reads features from the SageMaker Feature Store,
trains an XGBoost classifier, tracks the run in a SageMaker MLflow App, and
registers the model in the Model Registry.

Experiment tracking needs two packages that are NOT in the training container:

    pip install mlflow sagemaker-mlflow

`sagemaker-mlflow` is the SigV4 auth plugin for arn:aws:sagemaker:... tracking
URIs. Install `mlflow` alone and you get a connection error that never mentions
credentials. See track_run() for the cost warning about the OTHER MLflow
product -- read it before you create anything.

Usage (local testing):
    python churn_training_skeleton.py \
        --feature-group-name northstar-churn-features \
        --artifacts-bucket northstar-dev-artifacts \
        --max-depth 6 --eta 0.1 --num-round 200 \
        --mlflow-arn arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:<account>:mlflow-app/app-XXXX \
        --run-name xgb-depth6-eta0.1

Usage (SageMaker training job — parameters passed via hyperparameter dict):
    Configured via the SageMaker Python SDK Estimator.

    #    train/test split, and therefore different metrics, on every single run.
    #
    #    This was measured, not theorised: four runs on byte-identical data
    #    produced AUC between 0.7276 and 0.7431, and a Platinum-slice AUC
    #    between 0.430 and 0.700. An entire "the model is worse than random on
    #    your best customers" finding turned out to be an artefact of row order.
    #
    #    The rn = 1 filter guarantees customer_id is unique here, so ordering on
    #    it is a TOTAL order and the pipeline becomes reproducible.

    #    If your metrics move between runs and your data did not, this is why.

    PAIRED: each replicate resamples row indices once and scores BOTH models on
    those same rows, so the interval is on the difference and the correlation
    between the two models is preserved. Resampling them independently breaks
    the pairing and inflates the interval, which would make a real improvement
    look inconclusive.

    Replicates whose resample happens to be single-class are skipped, because
    AUC is undefined there.

    The seed is fixed so the gate is reproducible: the same split must always
    produce the same verdict.

      1. `create-mlflow-app` postdates many installed AWS CLIs. An old CLI

         is the SigV4 auth plugin for arn:aws:sagemaker:... tracking URIs.
         Without it you get a connection error that never mentions credentials.
