# Lab 2: Data & Feature Engineering

**Assigned:** Thu Sep 17 | **Due:** Sat Oct 3, midnight
**Chapter:** *Data & Feature Engineering*
**Builds on:** Lab 1 — your S3 bucket, VPC, MLEngineer role, and Terraform codebase
**Primary tool:** Terraform (all infrastructure changes are IaC from this point forward)

## Objective

Extend the NorthStar platform in two directions. First, harden the infrastructure left intentionally simple in Lab 1: move SageMaker into a private subnet behind a NAT Gateway, add the DataEngineer and ModelMonitor IAM roles, and add S3 lifecycle rules. Second, build the data pipeline that feeds the ML platform: raw data lands in S3, Glue crawls and transforms it, engineered features are written to SageMaker Feature Store.

By the end of this lab, you will have a working end-to-end data pipeline: raw customer event data → cleaned and transformed records → feature vectors in Feature Store → ready for model training in Lab 3.

---

## What's New in Lab 2

These are additions to Lab 1's foundation. Your existing Terraform modules will be modified and extended — not replaced.

| Component | Lab 1 State | Lab 2 Change |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| VPC networking | Public subnet only | Add private subnet + NAT Gateway; move SageMaker there |
| IAM roles | MLEngineer only | Add DataEngineer (Glue + Lambda trust) and ModelMonitor |
| S3 lifecycle rules | Deferred | Add 90-day expiration on `raw/`, version cleanup on all prefixes |
| Data ingestion | No pipeline | Glue crawler on `raw/` + ETL job → `processed/` |
| Feature engineering | No features | Glue ETL → `features/` + SageMaker Feature Group |

---

## Architecture Reference

This specification describes the **complete** Lab 2 platform — Lab 1 components plus all Lab 2 additions. Use it to build your architecture diagram before writing Terraform.

### What the Data Layer Needs to Do

The data pipeline must:

1. **Ingest raw data at rest** — customer transaction records and behavioral events land in `raw/` as CSV files
2. **Discover schema automatically** — a Glue Crawler scans `raw/` and registers the schema in the Glue Data Catalog so ETL jobs can query it without hardcoded column definitions
3. **Transform and validate** — a Glue ETL job reads from the catalog, applies type enforcement and null handling, and writes Parquet to `processed/`
4. **Engineer features and label them** — a second Glue ETL job reads `processed/`, splits it into an observation window and a holdout window, computes 13 churn-predictive features from the observation window, derives `churn_label` from the holdout, and writes to `features/`
5. **Register features for ML** — a SageMaker Feature Group ingests the feature vectors so training jobs in Labs 3–4 can pull them without re-computing
6. **Enforce data boundaries** — DataEngineer writes `raw/`, `processed/`, and `features/` but cannot write `artifacts/`; MLEngineer reads `features/` and writes `artifacts/`; ModelMonitor reads `artifacts/` and writes CloudWatch metrics only
7. **Expire stale data automatically** — raw files older than 90 days are deleted by S3 lifecycle rules

### Component Specification

---

#### Boundary: AWS Region `us-east-1`

---

##### Boundary: VPC — `northstar-dev-vpc` (extended from Lab 1)
- CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16` (unchanged)

---

###### Boundary: Availability Zone `us-east-1a`

**Public Subnet — `northstar-dev-public-1`** *(Lab 1 — no changes)*
- CIDR: `10.0.100.0/24`
- Now purpose: NAT Gateway anchor point only (Studio moved out of here)

→ Contains: **NAT Gateway — `northstar-dev-nat`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- Elastic IP: `northstar-dev-eip` (allocated, associated with NAT)
- Purpose: provides outbound internet access for the private subnet; SageMaker pulls ECR images, calls AWS APIs, reaches S3 via this path

**Private Subnet — `northstar-dev-private-1`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- CIDR: `10.0.1.0/24`
- Public IP on launch: no
- Contains: SageMaker Domain, Glue job workers

---

###### VPC-Level Network Resources

**Internet Gateway — `northstar-dev-igw`** *(Lab 1 — no changes)*

**Route Table — `northstar-dev-public-rt`** *(Lab 1 — updated association only)*
- Associated subnet: `northstar-dev-public-1`
- Routes: `0.0.0.0/0` → Internet Gateway

**Route Table — `northstar-dev-private-rt`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- Associated subnet: `northstar-dev-private-1`
- Routes: `0.0.0.0/0` → NAT Gateway
- Effect: private subnet resources reach the internet outbound; no inbound internet connections possible

**Security Group — `northstar-dev-sagemaker-sg`** *(Lab 1 — no changes)*

---

##### Regional Service: Amazon S3

**Bucket — `northstar-dev-data-{account-id}`** *(Lab 1 — extended)*
- All Lab 1 settings unchanged (versioning, SSE-S3, public access blocked)
- **New in Lab 2:** Lifecycle configuration added

Lifecycle rules *(new in Lab 2)*:

| Rule | Scope | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `expire-raw-data` | `raw/` | Delete current versions after 90 days |
| `expire-raw-versions` | `raw/` | Delete noncurrent versions after 30 days |
| `expire-processed-versions` | `processed/` | Delete noncurrent versions after 30 days |
| `expire-feature-versions` | `features/` | Delete noncurrent versions after 60 days |

---

##### Global Service: AWS IAM

**Role — `northstar-dev-MLEngineer`** *(Lab 1 — no changes)*

**Role — `northstar-dev-DataEngineer`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- Trust: `glue.amazonaws.com`, `lambda.amazonaws.com`, **`sagemaker.amazonaws.com`**
  (the third is required in Task 3: `CreateFeatureGroup` rejects an execution role that
  does not trust SageMaker, even though this role is otherwise a pure data-plane identity)
- Allowed:
  - Glue: full access (databases, tables, crawlers, jobs, runs) **plus `glue:GetConnection`**
  - EC2: network-interface lifecycle (`CreateNetworkInterface`, `DeleteNetworkInterface`, the `Describe*` calls) **plus `ec2:CreateTags` / `ec2:DeleteTags` on `network-interface/*`**
  - S3: read/write `raw/`, `processed/`, and `features/` prefixes
    (`features/` is required — the feature engineering job in Task 3 writes Parquet there
    and the Feature Store offline store is backed by it)
  - SageMaker Feature Store: `PutRecord`, `CreateFeatureGroup`, `DescribeFeatureGroup`
  - CloudWatch Logs: write
  - S3: read-only on `artifacts/glue/` (Glue must fetch its own job scripts)
- Denied by omission: cannot write `artifacts/`; cannot run SageMaker training jobs

**Role — `northstar-dev-ModelMonitor`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- Trust: `sagemaker.amazonaws.com`
- Allowed:
  - CloudWatch: `PutMetricData`, `GetMetricStatistics`, `PutMetricAlarm`, `DescribeAlarms`
  - SageMaker Model Monitor: create/manage/delete monitoring schedules
  - S3: read-only on `artifacts/` prefix
  - CloudWatch Logs: write
- Denied by omission: cannot invoke endpoints; cannot write to S3; cannot modify models

---

##### Regional Service: Amazon SageMaker

**Domain — `northstar-dev-domain`** *(Lab 1 — subnet changed)*
- Subnet: `northstar-dev-private-1` *(changed from public-1; Terraform forces replacement — ~10 min)*
- All other settings unchanged

**User Profile — `MLEngineer`** *(Lab 1 — no changes)*

**Feature Group — `northstar-dev-customer-features`** *(new in Lab 2)*
- Record identifier: `customer_id`
- Event time feature: `event_time`
- Online store: enabled (for real-time inference in Labs 3–4)
- Offline store: enabled, backed by the `features/offline-store/` prefix in S3

> **Keep the two `features/` writers apart.** The feature engineering job writes its own
> Parquet to `features/customers/`. The Feature Store offline store manages its own
> directory tree (`<account>/sagemaker/<region>/offline-store/...`) underneath whatever
> prefix you give it. Point them at the same prefix and the offline store's layout gets
> interleaved with your job output, which makes both hard to query. Use
> `features/customers/` for the job and `features/offline-store/` for Feature Store.
- IAM role: `northstar-dev-DataEngineer` (writes records); `northstar-dev-MLEngineer` (reads)
- Features — 16 definitions: 2 keys, 13 features, 1 label

| Feature | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_id` | String | Record identifier |
| `event_time` | Fractional | Unix epoch seconds — **not** an ISO 8601 string |
| `days_since_last_purchase` | Fractional | Recency at T |
| `customer_tenure_days` | Fractional | T minus first purchase |
| `purchase_frequency_30d` | Fractional | Orders in the 30 days before T |
| `purchase_frequency_90d` | Fractional | Orders in the 90 days before T |
| `purchase_frequency_180d` | Fractional | Orders in the 180 days before T |
| `avg_order_value` | Fractional | Mean order value, full history |
| `total_spend_90d` | Fractional | Spend in the 90 days before T |
| `total_lifetime_value` | Fractional | Sum of all order values |
| `avg_basket_size_6m` | Fractional | Mean items per order, last 180 days |
| `category_diversity_score` | Fractional | Distinct categories ÷ 8 |
| `online_to_store_ratio` | Fractional | 1.0 = pure online, 0.0 = pure in-store |
| `loyalty_tier` | String | Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum |
| `churn_risk_score` | Fractional | Rule-based recency heuristic, 0.0–1.0 — **not the label** |
| `churn_label` | **Integral** | 1 if no purchase in the holdout window, else 0 |

> **The temporal split is the point of this feature group.**
>
> ```
> |<------- observation window -------->|<--- holdout --->|
> 2025-04-01                       2026-04-01        2026-06-30
>                                       T             SNAPSHOT
> ```
>
> Every feature is computed **only** from purchases on or before `T`. `churn_label` is derived
> **only** from the holdout: 1 if the customer made no purchase in `(T, SNAPSHOT]`.
>
> Features describe the past; the label describes the future. This is the only construction
> that produces a model worth deploying. Compute recency over the full date range instead and
> it encodes the answer directly — you get a near-perfect AUC in the lab and a model that
> collapses the moment it sees real data. This is the single most common way churn models fail
> in industry, and it is why the split is baked into the lab rather than left as an exercise.
>
> `churn_risk_score` is retained deliberately and is **not** a substitute for the label. It is a
> pure recency rule, and Lab 3 requires your trained model to beat it. A model that cannot
> outperform a three-line heuristic has not earned its deployment.

> **Event time type — read this before you write the feature group.**
> SageMaker Feature Store accepts an event-time feature as either `String` (ISO 8601) or
> `Fractional` (Unix epoch seconds). This lab requires **`Fractional`**. If you declare the
> feature as `String` and then pass a numeric epoch value — or declare `Fractional` and pass
> an ISO string — `PutRecord` accepts the call and returns success, but the record never
> appears in the online store and never lands in the offline store. There is no error message.
> You will spend an afternoon debugging an empty feature group. Declare `Fractional`, and
> write `event_time` as `float(datetime.timestamp())` in the feature engineering job.

### Connection Map (Arrows for Your Diagram)

Draw this as two layers: infrastructure (VPC/network) and data flow (S3/Glue/Feature Store).

**Infrastructure layer:**

| From | To | Direction | Label |
|------|----|-----------|-------|
| Internet | Internet Gateway | ↔ | public traffic |
| Internet Gateway | Public Route Table | → | routes |
| Public Route Table | NAT Gateway | → | `0.0.0.0/0` |

| Private Route Table | NAT Gateway | → | `0.0.0.0/0` |
| Private Subnet | Private Route Table | → | associated |
| SageMaker Domain | Private Subnet | ↔ | runs in |
| Glue Job Workers | Private Subnet | ↔ | run in |

**Data flow layer:**

| From | To | Direction | Label |
|------|----|-----------|-------|
| Source data (external) | S3 `raw/customers/` | → | CSV upload |

## Starter Kit (Canvas: Lab 2)

- `northstar-raw-sample.csv` — roughly 19,500 synthetic **transaction** rows across 1,200 customers, spanning 2025-04-01 to 2026-06-30. Deliberately dirty: null `customer_id` values, duplicate `transaction_id` rows, mixed date formats, missing numeric fields, and stray whitespace — Task 2 is where you clean them.

  The date range is not arbitrary. It covers an observation window (to 2026-04-01) and a 90-day holdout after it, which is what makes the churn label in Task 3 possible. About 21% of customers churn, and roughly a third of those are still buying right up to the cutoff — those are the ones a recency rule will miss.

  Schema:

  | Column | Type | Notes |
  |--------|------|-------|
  | `transaction_id` | string | `TXN-{12 alphanumeric}`. Natural key — dedup on this. |
  | `customer_id` | string | `CUST-{8 digits}`. Repeats across rows by design. |
  | `purchase_date` | date | ISO 8601, with ~3% injected in `MM/DD/YYYY` to force real parsing |
  | `order_value` | float | USD, gross. ~4% null. |
  | `num_items` | integer | Line items in the order |
  | `payment_method` | string | `credit_card`, `debit_card`, `gift_card`, `cash` |
  | `channel` | string | `store` or `online` |
  | `store_id` | string | `STORE-{3 digits}`, or `ONLINE` |
  | `product_category` | string | Primary category for the order |

  Note there is no `loyalty_tier` column: tier is *derived* from lifetime value in Task 3. Feeding it in as raw input would leak the answer.
- `glue-scripts/transform.py` — starter Glue ETL script with the schema defined and read/write wired up; the three transform functions are stubbed out
- `glue-scripts/feature_engineer.py` — starter feature engineering script with the Feature Store client wired up; the four feature computations are stubbed out
- `verify-lab2.sh` — automated rubric verification script. Run it before you submit; it checks the same assertions the TA runs.

> **Note on `generate_northstar_data.py`.** Earlier drafts of this lab shipped a five-dataset,
> multi-million-row generator (transactions, clickstream, store events, product catalog). It has
> been moved out of the Lab 2 kit to `CS_401R_Labs/_retired/` — it was never run, and its output
> does not match the schema this lab's tasks are written against. Lab 2 uses the single
> transaction CSV above so Glue runs stay under a few minutes and inside the Free Tier credit
> budget. If a later lab needs richer multi-source data, that generator is the starting point.
>
> The sample CSV is generated by `data/generate_raw_sample.py` in the reference repository
> (seeded, so it reproduces exactly). Students receive the CSV, not the generator.

## Tasks

All infrastructure changes in this lab are made through Terraform. Do not use the console to create or modify resources (exception: the console is fine for verifying that resources exist as expected).

---

### Task 1 — Extend Platform Infrastructure (25 points)

Modify your existing Terraform modules and apply the changes to real AWS.

**Changes to `modules/vpc/`:**
- Add `aws_subnet` (private, `10.0.1.0/24`, `us-east-1a`, no public IP)
- Add `aws_eip` for the NAT Gateway
- Add `aws_nat_gateway` in the public subnet, dependent on the EIP
- Add `aws_route_table` for the private subnet with `0.0.0.0/0 → aws_nat_gateway`
- Add `aws_route_table_association` for the private subnet
- Add variable `enable_nat_gateway` (bool, default true) — set to false in `environments/local/`
- Update output to expose `private_subnet_id`

**Changes to `modules/storage/`:**
- Add `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` with the four rules from the Architecture Reference
- Add variable `enable_lifecycle_rules` (bool, default true) — set to false in `environments/local/`

**Changes to `modules/iam/`:**
- Add `northstar-dev-DataEngineer` role, policy, and attachment
- Add `northstar-dev-ModelMonitor` role, policy, and attachment

**Changes to `modules/sagemaker/`:**
- Update `subnet_ids` in `aws_sagemaker_domain` to use the new private subnet
- Set `app_network_access_type = "VpcOnly"` so Studio egress routes through the NAT Gateway instead of straight out the Internet Gateway
- If you still have Lab 1 running, both of these force **replacement** — Terraform destroys and recreates the domain (~10 min). That is expected, not a mistake; run `terraform plan` first and confirm the replacement is the only destructive change. If you destroyed Lab 1 after submitting (as required), the domain is simply created fresh, which takes about the same time.

> **ASCII only in AWS-facing description fields.** EC2 rejects any non-ASCII character in a security group's `description` with `InvalidParameterValue: Character sets beyond ASCII are not supported`. If you pasted an em dash (—), a curly quote, or an arrow into a `description`, `terraform apply` fails at `CreateSecurityGroup` — but `terraform validate` and LocalStack both accept it, so you will not catch this until you hit real AWS. Use plain hyphens in any `description` argument that Terraform sends to an AWS API. (Confusingly, IAM *does* accept non-ASCII in policy descriptions — so the failure looks arbitrary.)

**Changes to `environments/dev/variables.tf`:**
- Add `private_subnet_cidr` (string, `"10.0.1.0/24"`)

**Apply the changes:**

```bash
cd infrastructure/environments/dev
terraform plan    # review carefully — you should see the SageMaker domain marked for replacement
terraform apply 2>&1 | tee ../../../docs/lab2-extend-output.txt
```

**LocalStack validation (update local environment):**

```bash
# environments/local/main.tf additions:
# - vpc module: enable_nat_gateway = false
# - storage module: enable_lifecycle_rules = false
# - iam module: now creates all 3 roles
make local-validate 2>&1 | tee docs/lab2-localstack-output.txt
```

**Rubric:**

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Private subnet + NAT Gateway created; SageMaker Domain moved to private subnet | 10 | Console: Domain InService, subnet ID matches `northstar-dev-private-1`; NAT Gateway Available |
| All 3 IAM roles exist with correct trust and policies | 8 | `aws iam list-roles` shows all 3; `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` confirms DataEngineer cannot **write** `artifacts/` (read on `artifacts/glue/` is expected — Glue fetches job scripts there), ModelMonitor cannot write S3 |
| S3 lifecycle rules applied | 4 | `aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration` returns all 4 rules |
| LocalStack validation updated and passing | 3 | `docs/lab2-localstack-output.txt` shows 3 IAM roles; VPC exists (NAT skipped) |

---

### Task 2 — Data Ingestion Pipeline (25 points)

Build a new `modules/glue/` module and create the Glue catalog, crawler, and transform ETL job.

**New `modules/glue/` resources:**
- `aws_glue_catalog_database` — `northstar_dev`
- `aws_glue_crawler` — `northstar-dev-raw-crawler`, targets `raw/customers/` prefix, role = DataEngineer ARN
- `aws_glue_job` — `northstar-dev-transform`, Glue version 4.0, Python 3, script from S3 (upload `glue-scripts/transform.py` to `artifacts/glue/` prefix)
- `aws_s3_object` — upload the transform script as part of `terraform apply`

> **Running Glue inside the VPC — three failures you will hit in this order.**
> Because Lab 2 places Glue workers in the private subnet, the job needs a Glue
> `NETWORK` connection, and that path has three separate prerequisites. Each one fails at
> *provisioning* time with a message that does not obviously name the fix, and each only
> appears after you have cleared the previous one:
>
> 1. `DataCatalog Connection issue ... not authorized to perform: glue:GetConnection` —
>    the role needs `glue:GetConnection`. Glue resolves the connection before your script
>    ever runs, so this is not a script bug.
> 2. `At least one security group must open all ingress ports.` — Glue requires a
>    **self-referencing** all-ports ingress rule on an attached security group. An
>    equivalent rule written as the VPC CIDR does *not* satisfy the check; the source must
>    literally be the security group itself (`self = true` in Terraform).
> 3. `The specified role doesn't have a permission to create a tag for your elastic
>    network interface.` — Glue tags every ENI it creates, so the role needs
>    `ec2:CreateTags` and `ec2:DeleteTags` on `arn:aws:ec2:*:*:network-interface/*`.
>
> Also note that IAM changes take a few seconds to propagate. If you fix a policy and
> immediately re-run the job, you can see the *old* error once more — wait ~30 seconds
> before concluding your fix did not work.

**Complete the transform script** `glue-scripts/transform.py`:

The starter script defines the schema. You must implement the three transform functions:

```python
def cast_types(df):
    """Cast all columns to the types defined in SCHEMA. Drop rows where customer_id is null."""
    # Your implementation here

def impute_nulls(df):
    """
    Numeric columns: impute with column median.
    String columns: impute with 'unknown'.
    """
    # Your implementation here

def deduplicate(df):
    """
    Drop duplicate transactions: keep one row per transaction_id, taking the
    most recently loaded (by purchase_date descending) when a transaction_id
    appears more than once.

    Deduplicate on transaction_id, NOT on customer_id. A customer is expected
    to have many transactions -- that purchase history is exactly what the
    feature engineering job in Task 3 aggregates over. Collapsing to one row
    per customer here would make total_lifetime_value and purchase_frequency_30d
    impossible to compute downstream.
    """
    # Your implementation here
```

> **Why the grain matters.** `raw/customers/` holds *transaction-level* rows: one row per
> purchase, many rows per customer. The transform job preserves that grain and only removes
> genuine duplicates — the same `transaction_id` landing twice from an ingestion retry.
> Task 3 is where the data collapses to one row per customer, by aggregation. Getting this
> backwards is the single most common way to fail Task 3 after passing Task 2.

**Upload sample data and run the pipeline:**

```bash
# Upload sample data
aws s3 cp northstar-raw-sample.csv \
  s3://northstar-dev-data-$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)/raw/customers/northstar-raw-sample.csv

# Run the crawler (waits for completion)
aws glue start-crawler --name northstar-dev-raw-crawler
aws glue get-crawler --name northstar-dev-raw-crawler --query 'Crawler.State'

# Verify the table was created
aws glue get-table --database-name northstar_dev --name raw_customers

# Run the transform job
aws glue start-job-run --job-name northstar-dev-transform
aws glue get-job-run --job-name northstar-dev-transform \
  --run-id $(aws glue get-job-runs --job-name northstar-dev-transform \
    --query 'JobRuns[0].Id' --output text)

# Verify processed output
aws s3 ls s3://northstar-dev-data-ACCOUNT_ID/processed/customers/ --recursive
```

**Rubric:**

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Glue catalog database and `raw_customers` table exist after crawler run | 6 | `aws glue get-table --database-name northstar_dev --name raw_customers` returns schema |
| Transform script correctly casts types, imputes nulls, deduplicates | 12 | `verify-lab2.sh` runs assertions against `processed/customers/` output: correct Parquet schema, 0 null `customer_id` rows, no duplicate `customer_id` rows |
| `modules/glue/` Terraform resources applied cleanly | 4 | Module present in repo; `terraform apply` creates crawler and job with 0 errors |
| Transform job completes with SUCCEEDED status | 3 | `aws glue get-job-run` returns `JobRunState: SUCCEEDED` |

---

### Task 3 — Feature Engineering and Labelling (20 points)

Add the feature engineering ETL job to `modules/glue/` and a new `modules/feature_store/` module.

**Add to `modules/glue/`:**
- `aws_glue_job` — `northstar-dev-feature-engineer`, reads `processed/customers/`, writes to `features/customers/` and calls Feature Store

**New `modules/feature_store/`:**
- `aws_sagemaker_feature_group` — `northstar-dev-customer-features`
  - Record identifier: `customer_id`
  - Event time: `event_time`
  - Online store: enabled
  - Offline store: S3 URI `s3://northstar-dev-data-{account-id}/features/offline-store/`
  - Execution role: DataEngineer role ARN
  - Feature definitions: all 8 features from the Architecture Reference

> **Two Feature Store permission traps, both with misleading error messages.**
>
> 1. `ValidationException: The execution role ARN is invalid` — this does *not* mean the ARN
>    is wrong. It means the role's trust policy is missing `sagemaker.amazonaws.com`. Add it
>    to DataEngineer's trusted services.
> 2. `ValidationException: Invalid S3Uri provided` — the URI is fine. The role is missing
>    `s3:GetBucketAcl` on the bucket. Feature Store checks the bucket ACL before accepting it
>    as an offline store target. You also need `s3:PutObjectAcl` on `features/*`, because the
>    offline store writes objects with an ACL and plain `PutObject` is not enough.
>
> Both fail at `terraform apply`, before any data moves, so a green `terraform validate` tells
> you nothing here.

**Anchor your time windows to the data, not to `today()`.** Compute recency and the 30-day
frequency window relative to the maximum `purchase_date` in the dataset. If you use the wall
clock, your features change every time the job runs, and any model Lab 3 trains on them stops
being reproducible.

**Complete the feature engineering script** `glue-scripts/feature_engineer.py`:

The starter script reads from `processed/customers/`. Implement these feature computations:

**Run and verify:**

```bash
# Run feature engineering job
aws glue start-job-run --job-name northstar-dev-feature-engineer

# Verify features written to S3
aws s3 ls s3://northstar-dev-data-ACCOUNT_ID/features/customers/ --recursive

# Verify Feature Store records (after job completes — offline store has ~15 min lag)
aws sagemaker describe-feature-group --feature-group-name northstar-dev-customer-features
```

**Rubric:**

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| All 5 feature functions implemented correctly | 10 | `verify-lab2.sh` checks: no null feature values, all 4 tiers present, `churn_risk_score` in [0, 1], one row per customer |
| Temporal split correct — features from history, label from holdout | 4 | `churn_label` rate between 15% and 30%; no feature computed from post-cutoff data |
| Feature Group created via Terraform with all 16 definitions | 3 | `aws sagemaker describe-feature-group` returns 16 features; `event_time` Fractional; `churn_label` Integral; online store Enabled |
| Feature engineering job completes with SUCCEEDED status | 3 | `aws glue get-job-run` returns SUCCEEDED |

### Task 4 — Data Contract and Lineage (15 points)

**Data Contract** — write `docs/lab2-data-contract.md`:

A data contract is a formal agreement between the team that produces a dataset and the team that consumes it. It specifies schema, quality guarantees, and SLAs. Write one for the `processed/customers/` dataset:

```markdown
## Data Contract: processed/customers

### Producer
Team / process: Glue ETL job `northstar-dev-transform`

### Consumers
- Feature engineering job `northstar-dev-feature-engineer`
- (Future) Direct model training in Lab 3

### Schema
| Column | Type | Nullable | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
[fill in all columns from the processed dataset]

### Quality Guarantees
- `customer_id` is never null
- No duplicate `customer_id` rows
- All numeric columns are within expected ranges (specify bounds)
- `purchase_date` is a valid ISO 8601 date

### SLA
- Data is available in `processed/customers/` within 2 hours of landing in `raw/customers/`

### Versioning
- Schema changes require a new S3 prefix (e.g., `processed/customers/v2/`)
- Breaking changes require consumer notification 5 business days in advance
```

**Data Lineage Diagram** — create `docs/lab2-data-lineage.png`:

Draw a lineage diagram showing the full flow from source to Feature Store. Include: source system → S3 `raw/` → Glue Crawler → Catalog → Transform Job → S3 `processed/` → Feature Engineer Job → S3 `features/` + Feature Store. Label each arrow with the data format (CSV, Parquet, Feature Store records) and the IAM role performing each write.

**Rubric:**

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Data contract covers schema, quality guarantees, SLA, and versioning policy | 8 | All four sections present; quality guarantees include at least 3 specific, measurable assertions |
| Lineage diagram is accurate and complete | 7 | All nodes in the data flow present; formats labeled on each edge; IAM roles labeled on each write edge |

---

### Task 5 — Repository Quality (15 points)

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `modules/glue/` and `modules/feature_store/` present with correct resources | 4 | All resources in correct modules; no cross-module duplication |
| All Glue and Feature Store resource names parameterized | 3 | No hardcoded strings in `.tf` files for new modules |
| `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` pass on all modules | 3 | Clean output from both commands |
| `docs/lab2-extend-output.txt` shows a successful apply | 3 | File ends with `Apply complete!` and contains `aws_sagemaker_domain`. Either outcome is acceptable: **replacement** if you still had Lab 1 running, **creation** if you destroyed Lab 1 as instructed. Both are correct. |
| README updated to describe Lab 2 additions | 2 | README explains new modules, how to run the data pipeline end-to-end |

---

### Teardown (required — read before you submit)

**The NAT Gateway bills roughly $0.045/hour (~$32/month) whether or not you send a byte through it.** It is the single largest cost in this lab and it does not stop when you close the console. Leaving it running for three weeks will consume a meaningful share of your $200 in Free Tier credits — credits you still need for Labs 3 through 7.

After you have captured your verification output and submitted:

```bash
bash scripts/teardown-lab2.sh
```

> **`terraform destroy` alone will not tear this lab down.** Six resources are created
> outside Terraform's state and survive it. Three of them make `destroy` hang for 10+ minutes
> and then fail; one of them keeps billing after you believe you are finished.
>
> | # | Orphan | Consequence |
> |---|--------|-------------|
> | 1 | Glue ENIs left in the private subnet after job runs | Subnet and security group deletion hang |
> | 2 | **SageMaker Studio EFS filesystem** | Terraform never sees it — **it keeps billing**, and its mount target blocks the subnet |
> | 3 | Two auto-created SageMaker NFS security groups | VPC deletion hangs |
> | 4 | S3 object versions | `BucketNotEmpty` — a versioned bucket will not delete while non-empty |
> | 5 | `sagemaker_featurestore` Glue database | Left behind by the offline store |
> | 6 | SageMaker **lineage contexts and artifacts** | Survive `DeleteFeatureGroup`; refuse to delete until their associations are unwound first |
>
> `scripts/teardown-lab2.sh` handles all six in the correct order and then verifies that no
> billable resource remains. If you insist on running `terraform destroy` by hand, expect to
> clean up items 1–6 manually and to wait through two failed attempts first.
>
> **Do not trust the AWS console's Resource Explorer to confirm teardown.** Its index lags by
> minutes to hours and will keep listing resources that are already gone — and it may equally
> miss ones that remain. Verify with `aws` CLI calls against the live API, which is what
> `scripts/teardown-lab2.sh` does in its final step.
>
> Item 4 is also why `modules/storage/` sets `force_destroy` in the dev environment. That is
> the right call for synthetic, regenerable lab data and **the wrong call for a bucket holding
> real customer records** — it deletes every version with no confirmation.

Commit `docs/lab2-destroy-output.txt`. Lab 3 begins by re-running `terraform apply`, which rebuilds everything from your committed code in about 15 minutes — that rebuild is itself the proof that your infrastructure is genuinely reproducible.

| Item | Points | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Infrastructure destroyed after submission | — | `docs/lab2-destroy-output.txt` ends with `Destroy complete!` **and** `scripts/teardown-lab2.sh` reports no billable resources remaining. **Gate, not points:** if this evidence is missing, Task 1 is capped at half credit until you produce it. |
